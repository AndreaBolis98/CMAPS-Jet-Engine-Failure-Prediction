# CMAPS-Jet-Engine-Failure-Prediction

## Problem Statement

Prognostics and Health Management (PHM) is a crucial field in industry for predicting asset conditions, preventing failures, and reducing unplanned downtime. This dataset, derived from a well-known NASA public dataset, is widely used for asset degradation modeling. It contains run-to-failure simulated data from turbofan jet engines.

## Prediction Goal

Originally, the dataset was intended for predicting the Remaining Useful Life (RUL) of each engine, estimating the number of remaining cycles before failure. However, this project converts the regression problem into a classification task to simplify decision-making in predictive maintenance. 

### Classification Approach

A threshold-based approach is applied to RUL values, defining two distinct classes:

- **Class 0**: The engine is operating normally and is not in a critical state.
- **Class 1**: The engine is approaching failure and requires maintenance.

## Dataset Description

The dataset contains multiple time-series sensor readings for different engines, each identified by an `engine_id`. Key features include:

- **Operational Settings**: Variables such as altitude, throttle position, and speed.
- **Sensor Readings**: Various sensor measurements monitoring engine health.

The data is structured in a way that allows tracking the performance of each engine over time until failure.

## Methodology

1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Handling missing values.
   - Feature scaling and normalization.
   - Labeling RUL values based on a pre-defined threshold.

2. **Feature Engineering**:
   - Creating derived features from sensor readings.
   - Aggregating past cycles for better predictive power.

3. **Model Training**:
   - Comparison of machine learning models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Neural Networks).
   - Hyperparameter tuning for model optimization.

4. **Evaluation**:
   - Performance assessment using precision, recall, and F1-score.
   - Validation on unseen engine data.

## Models Used

Several machine learning models were tested and evaluated, including:

- **SVC First Search**
- **SVC Optimization**
- **XGBoost Optimization**
- **LightGBM (LGBM)**
- **CatBoost**
- **Voting Classifier**

## Results

The classification model effectively predicts when an engine is approaching failure, aiding in proactive maintenance decisions. The results show that predictive maintenance strategies can be significantly improved using machine learning.

## Conclusion

In our application, the most crucial factor in selecting the best model is its ability to minimize false negativesâ€”instances where an engine failure (Class 1) is incorrectly classified as a normal condition (Class 0). This makes **recall** the key metric, as it ensures that the model correctly identifies the highest number of actual failures, reducing the risk of undetected critical issues.

Among the tested models, the **Voting Classifier** demonstrated the best performance in terms of recall, achieving **84.4%**, making it the most reliable model for failure detection. By leveraging an ensemble approach, the Voting Classifier combines the strengths of multiple models, ensuring a more effective predictive maintenance system.

This result suggests that **ensemble methods** are particularly well-suited for applications where the cost of missing a failure is high. Future work could explore further optimizations of the ensemble approach, potentially integrating deep learning techniques or refining the feature selection process to enhance predictive accuracy.

## Future Work

- Incorporating deep learning techniques like LSTMs for time-series forecasting.
- Extending the model to multi-class classification for more granular failure predictions.
- Enhancing feature selection to improve accuracy.
